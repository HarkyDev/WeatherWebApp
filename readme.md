## ABOUT THIS PROJECT
The concept of the project is as follows; A user should be able to load up the site, search for the city of their choice have the relative information of weather presented to them and a 5 day forecast from the day of the search shown below. The user should also have their searches saved underneath the search bar and able to click them to search that said previous search again without having to re-type. 


The technical idea for this project was to demonstrate the use of two apis and having the second api pull and make its request from the first apis return information. 

## SOME OF THE ISSUES 
A big issue I had when coding this project was after dynamically generating the buttons based on the users search history/userInput allowing the buttons to all share one universal function but also have the code read the innerHTML for the relative button being clicked. I fixed this by using an event.target method and it really helped me understand its usage. I also would have liked to generate the cards at the bottom using one loop rather than write each manually but could not mange to do it due to time constraints, I may however come back and update the code to fix this as a challenge when more time can be found.
